# GameAI Exercise 01: Patrolling & Wander
## About
The following repository was created to host class exercise 01 from Game AI lesson in CITM UPC university.

The main objective of this exercise was to implement some of the most basic AI algorithms like agent **Patrolling** and **Wander** techniques. To do so, we used Unity game engine in its **2021.3.14f1 version** and some free assets from the Unity Assets Store and then we implemented the algorithms using C# Unity scripts.

The first agent (the cop) uses a patrolling movement using waypoints and the ghost smoothing technique. The initial point and direction are randomly selected. Then the other agents (the ghosts) move using a wandering movement until they detect the cop close, and then they start chasing him. Some other fancy features were implemented, as well as some different cameras on "Display" 1 , 2 and 3.
